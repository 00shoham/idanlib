This library has a handful of dependencies.

On an Ubuntu system, you satisfy them as follows:

apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev liblua5.4-dev uuid-dev

They are:

  * libcurl - used to fetch content from web sites, with support
    for https, proxies, etc.

  * lua - used for running simple scripts at runtime.

  * uuid - used to generate globally unique identifiers.

Not every project I work on requires all of these, but each of these
is required by at least one project...  Hence, this project includes
all of the dependencies (and no, I don't plan to remove any).
